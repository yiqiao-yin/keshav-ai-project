### Human: How can I get on the waitlist for the Tiny House Empowerment Village shelter?
### Assistant: Due to this, the shelter is no longer maintaining its own waitlist. Only those who qualify for Coordinated Entry's Crisis Assessment are now eligible. To be considered for a spot, you can either drop in or call a Housing Resource Center and ask if you qualify for the Crisis Assessment, mentioning that you want to be referred to the Tiny House Empowerment Village shelter.
